 Deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is a data structure where we can add and remove the elements from both the ends of the queue. 
 This interface extends the queue interface. The class which implements this interface is ArrayDeque. 
 Since this class implements the deque, we can instantiate a deque object with this class.
  It can either be used as a queue(first-in-first-out/FIFO) or as a stack(last-in-first-out/LIFO). Deque is the acronym for double ended queue.
