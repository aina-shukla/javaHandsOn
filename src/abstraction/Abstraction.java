	// In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can
	// achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.
//An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
	// Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared
	// with abstract keyword.
