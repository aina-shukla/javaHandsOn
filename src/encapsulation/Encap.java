	// encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being
	// accessed by the code outside this shield.
//Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
	// As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it
	// is also known as data-hiding.
